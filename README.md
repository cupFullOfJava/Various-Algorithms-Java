# Various Algorithms Java

This is sort of a catch-all for a variety of algorithms that I will be updating over the next few months.  It is intended to further my knowledge, as well as provide some examples to the community.


For my own notes I intend to eventually implement:
- In place merge sort & heap sort with linear time heap building.
- Breadth first traversals of graphs & trees. 
- Dijkstra's algorithm w/ fibonacci heap
- Kruskal's algorithm w/ union find by rank
- deterministic quick select
- polymorphic type inference
- 2D voronoi diagram generation
- 2D convex hull generation
- Knapsack & related DP problems
- Ford–Fulkerson algorithm for max flow.
